# 1st-Updated-Profile
## My updated and upgraded version of my profile.

This is my portfolio I created while in Thinkful's Engineering Immersion Program. I created this portfolio to display my talents and love for code. Not only does my portfolio give direct links to projects I've created but it is a show of some of my skills as well. The web page is completely responsive so you can view it properly across different devices. In creating this portfolio I used and combination of HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and media queries for the responsive design. Most of the code was established strictly in VS Code but to get the design exactly the way I wanted, I used Google Dev Tools. Using Google Dev Tools showed me some errors in my code and some default setting that shifted the design in an unintented way. As I grow as a React developer, I plan to update my portfolio to reflect my current level of skill.
