          <h2>Hi. I'm Theodore Jones.</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a web developer with a natural knack for understanding code. I'm
            a student in Thinkful's Cohort 49 and I've been enjoying it. The
            many friends I've met and the countless riddles I had to solve...
            loving it all. I'm so ready for the next stage in my new coding
            life!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm looking forward to meeting my soon-to-be co-workers and bounce
            ideas off of them. I've been in a couple of teams and I love it when
            we collect our thoughts. I'm hoping to meet more amazing minds and
            create something great together! My thing seems to be thinking
            around the box.

        <h2 id="about">About me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in New Orleans, LA. I just recently moved back
          after 4 long years in Atlanta, GA.. I've always had a love for
          technology, of all kinds. I first started on a computer with nothing
          but Dos on it. That was fun because every time I would find out how to
          use a new command it was like opening up a new world for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was 3 years old when I was trying to master Dos. A couple of years
          later I found myself making websites for fun from HTML code. Then I
          found myself designing MySpace Pages. Then a little later I found
          myself making simple animations with flash. So it's always been in me
          to be a developer of some sort! Thinkful has supplied me with a unique
          opportunity to jump into what I love! I am now classified as a
          Frontend React Developer. What that means is I can build you vibrant
          and responsive web applications! Check out my portfolio
          <a href="#port">here</a>!
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of my hobbies include outdoor activities, music, games, and
          trading the markets. I believe most of my hobbies have led me to
          technology because they come from technology. Playing video games is
          probably my favorite hobby by far! I'm into games where your character
          exists in a world where they can create some sort of life. Games like
          Elder Scrolls, Ark, and Cavilry II are great examples of how I like to
          squad up!
